# Python learning

Hello dears, this will be my pseudo-blog about my way through the `Python`. I was programming in `Python` before, but I want to start from scratch since I use `C#` and `ASP.NET Core` for the development. For now I want to learn `Python` due some preferences based on `Linux` development and so. 

This "blog" will be written from my point of view where I will be describing everything for me and my notices and some examples and differences from `C#`. I will probably not learn `Django` and web development with `Python` since I really prefere the `ASP.NET Core` with `LINQ` and `Entity Framework`, so...

## Python version 3.11.1

For the Python development I will use the newest version of `Python` which is `3.11.1`. 

### Download Python

`Python` can be downloaded from it's official course or installed via `terminal`. So go ahead and visit www.python.org to download the newest version of `Python`.

- `Python` for `Windows` can be downloaded from the official site https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/
- `Python` for `Linux` can be installed via terminal by running `sudo apt install python3 -y`
- - *NOTE: There is an attribute `-y` which will confirm the installation of the package so you will skip that step.*
