# Python learning

Hello dears, this will be my pseudo-blog about my way through the Python. I was programming in Python before, but I want to start from scratch since I use C# and ASP.NET Core for the development. For now I want to learn Python due some preferences based on Linux development and so. 

This "blog" will be written from my point of view where I will be describing everything for me and my notices and some examples and differences from C#. I will probably not learn `Django` and web development with Python since I really prefere the `ASP.NET Core` with `LINQ` and `Entity Framework`, so...

## Python version

For the Python development I will use the newest version of Python which is `3.11.1` for Linux `3.10.8`. 

### Download Python

Python can be downloaded from it's official course or installed via `terminal`. So go ahead and visit www.python.org to download the newest version of `Python`.

- `Python` for `Windows` can be downloaded from the official site https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ or use MS Store instead: https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NRWMJP3717K
- `Python` for `Linux` can be installed via terminal by running 

```
# apt install python3
```

*NOTE: Python version on Linux will be **3.10.8***

## Choosing IDE

For the development I will mostly use [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)

You can choose one of free IDE for the Python development such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

It's all about you preferences and feel free to experiment with each IDE what would YOU prefere the most.
